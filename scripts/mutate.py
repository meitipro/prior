"""
Break every defence in the contract, one at a time, and name the test that notices.

    python scripts/mutate.py                          # run, print the table
    python scripts/mutate.py --table docs/MUTATIONS.md

A passing count is a claim; a table of mutations, each named with the test that
killed it, is evidence. Each mutant is a copy of contracts/prior.py with one
defence removed or weakened. The direct and static tests run against it through
PRIOR_CONTRACT, and the first failing test is recorded as the kill.

A kill is read from pytest's own report of which test failed, never from an
exit code alone: a runner that scores exit codes reports a perfect run while
testing nothing. The tests that compare the file with a generated copy or with
the deployed record are left out, because they fail for ANY edit and would kill
every mutant without testing its defence.

If anything escapes, the table is not written and the escapes are printed. An
escape means a missing test, or a defence strict enough elsewhere that this one
can no longer fail, and either is a finding.
